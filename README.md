## Hi, I'm Fawaz 

- ### I'm a software developer and I like experimenting with all kinds of programming related nonsense :)
- ### Currently trying to get into backend development specifically with the _ol' reliable_ `Java` in my toolbox
- ### Things I'm interested in -
  - Linux (and of course `Bash`)
  - Data storage & progression over time 

Picture of me getting distracted by the wonders of computers -
